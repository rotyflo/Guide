### Required Reading

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

This method requires temporary access to a Nintendo DSi that is compatible with your flashcart. This method uses the flashcart to run the ntrboot flasher `.nds` file on your DSi. This means that your flashcart must support launching `.nds` files on your DSi's version. See the flashcart table on [ntrboot](ntrboot) for more information.

Note that in some rare cases, it may be possible fer th' flashin' process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart n' render it permanently unusable. 'Tis be unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts be supported. To reduce th' chance 'o recievin' a counterfeit card, it be recommended that ye use a reputable site to be buyin' ye flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
