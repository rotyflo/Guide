## What be Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. This includes homebrew tools, applications, games, and emulators.

In many cases, runnin' homebrew on ye device be 100% free usin' jus' th' Nintendo 3DS Sound app. There also be various other exploits in commercial games 'n th' browser fer gettin' homebrew runnin'.

## What be Custom Firmware?

**Custom Firmware** ("CFW") enables ye to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. Fer instance, signature patches let ye be installin' unsigned titles that appear right on ye HOME Menu.

CFW can be set up on any console on any version (but 'tis may require additional tools / accessories fer versions >11.3.0).

## What does 'tis guide install?

'Tis guide has th' end goal 'o takin' a completely unmodified 3DS from stock
firmware to boot9strap powered Custom Firmware. On some versions, it utilizes homebrew as a steppin' off point, but Custom Firmware be still th' goal.

boot9strap be th' newest 'n best method 'o launchin' Custom Firmware that gives us nearly full control 'o th' system only milliseconds into boot, which be similar to th' effect 'o BootMii fer th' Wii. It be givin' us even earlier control than arm9loaderhax did, 'n unlike standard sighax, boot9strap uses an NDMA overwrite exploit in order to be gainin' Boot9 code execution. 'Tis be meanin' that any console runnin' boot9strap be capable 'o dumpin' th' console unique OTP (`OTP.bin`), th' ARM11 bootrom (`boot11.bin`), 'n th' ARM9 bootrom (`boot9.bin`).

Th' benefits 'o boot9strap over other Custom Firmware launch methods be bountiful, 'n as such it be recommended to use 'tis guide over any other that be relyin' on outdated software (such as menuhax + rxTools, arm9loaderhax, or even normal sighax).

For information on how boot9strap works, please see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00359).

For a list of each of the calculated sighax signatures, see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/SciresM/cdd2266efb80175d37eabbe86f9d8c52).

## What can I do wit' Custom Firmware?

+ Play all game cards 'n eShop games, regardless 'o region
+ Customize ye HOME Menu wit' user-created [themes 'n splash screens](https://themeplaza.eu/)
+ Use "ROM hacks" fer games that ye own
+ Take gameplay 'n application screenshots
+ Back up, edit, 'n restore saves fer many games
+ Play games fer older systems wit' various emulators, usin' RetroArch or other standalone emulators. (Works best wit' a New Nintendo 3DS)
+ Install homebrew titles to ye system, 'n have 'em appear on ye HOME Menu
+ Dump ye game cards to a format ye can install, 'n play them without needin' th' card
+ New 3DS or New 2DS only: stream live gameplay to ye PC wirelessly wit' NTR CFW
+ Run many old Nintendo DS flash carts that were blocked long ago or never worked on Nintendo 3DS
+ Safely update to th' latest system version without fear 'o losin' access to homebrew

## What do I need to be knowin' before startin'?

+ **Before beginnin' th' guide, ye must be knowin' th' risks 'o 3DS hackin': EVERY time ye be modifyin' ye system, there be always th' potential fer an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They be rare, but still a possibility so make sure ye follow ALL directions EXACTLY.**
+ If ye have already hacked ye 3DS before to get an EmuNAND setup, 'n would like to move th' contents 'o ye previous EmuNAND to ye new SysNAND CFW, ye should follow all instructions 'n be restorin' ye existin' EmuNAND when prompted once ye reach [Finalizin' Setup](finalizing-setup).
+ This guide will work on New 3DS, Old 3DS, New 2DS, and Old 2DS in all regions on firmware 11.8.0 or below.
+ If everythin' goes accordin' to plan, ye gunna lose no data 'n be endin' up wit' everythin' that ye started wit' (games, NNID, saves, etc gunna be preserved).
+ Keep ye device plugged in 'n charged throughout th' entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off!
+ Ye SD card should be [MBR, not GPT](http://www.howtogeek.com/245610/) (th' SD card that comes wit' ye device gunna be MBR by default).
+ If you need to format a brand new SD card, you can use [guiformat](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) and set to an Allocation Unit Size of 32K (32768).
+ Th' 2DS be essentially identical to th' Old 3DS in terms 'o software, so any steps which say "Old 3DS" also apply to 2DS.
