### Required Reading

All game cartridges contain a copy of the required system version to play it, allowing anyone on a lower version to use the cartridge to update to that version (even without an internet connection).

{% capture notice-1 %}

Note that cartridge updates will only deliver updates to core features, such as the System Settings, Home Menu, etc. cartridge updates will not deliver updates to Nintendo 3DS Sound and Network features, such as System Transfer, Internet Browser, StreetPass Mii Plaza, or eShop.

This means that using a cartridge update from a version containing an older Nintendo 3DS Sound version *(<3.0.0)* to one that introduced a newer Nintendo 3DS Sound version will break [Soundhax](homebrew-launcher-(soundhax))! Ye gunna be needin' an [alternate method](homebrew-launcher-(alternatives)) 'o enterin' th' Homebrew Launcher!

This also means that a cartridge update will NOT install a browser if you do not already have one. 'Tis gunna **only** be updatin' th' actual system version *(fer example, 2.1.0-0 -> 6.0.0-0)*. Th' last number *(th' -0)* gunna **not** change.

**Updating with a game cartridge containing the version 9.9.0 or above will remove your browser until a standard online update is performed!**
