### Required Reading

홈브류 런처는 다양한 방법을 통해 실행할 수 있습니다.

Soundhax (when combined with the Homebrew Launcher) is compatible with versions 9.0.0 through 11.3.0 in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions.

Ensure your device's Wireless Communication is turned on as udsploit (used in the next page) will need the wireless module to be active to function, and some devices (New 3DS, New 2DS, and Old 2DS) cannot adjust the Wireless Communication setting from the Homebrew Launcher. Wireless Communication only has to be on; connecting it to an access point is not required.

To extract the `.7z` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

Note that cartridge updates will only deliver updates to core features, such as the System Settings, Home Menu, etc. cartridge updates will not deliver updates to Nintendo 3DS Sound and Network features, such as System Transfer, Internet Browser, StreetPass Mii Plaza, or eShop.

This means that using a cartridge update from a version containing an older Nintendo 3DS Sound version *(<3.0.0)* to one that introduced a newer Nintendo 3DS Sound version will break Soundhax! 홈브류 런처 접속에 [대안](homebrew-launcher-(alternatives))이 필요할 것입니다!
