### Required Reading

이 설명은 SysNAND를 기준으로 제작되었으므로 기기가 EmuNAND 기반이라면 모든 과정을 SysNAND에 적용해 주세요. EmuNAND와 RedNAND는 [동일한 개념](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection)을 다른 방식으로 구현한 것입니다.

Soundhax (when combined with pre9otherapp) is compatible with versions 4.0.0 through 8.1.0 in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions.

To extract the `.7z` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

{% capture notice-1 %}

Note that cartridge updates will only deliver updates to core features, such as the System Settings, Home Menu, etc. cartridge updates will not deliver updates to Nintendo 3DS Sound and Network features, such as System Transfer, Internet Browser, StreetPass Mii Plaza, or eShop.

This means that using a cartridge update from a version containing an older Nintendo 3DS Sound version *(<3.0.0)* to one that introduced a newer Nintendo 3DS Sound version will break Soundhax! You will need an alternate method of entering the Homebrew Launcher such as [Installing boot9strap (Browser)](installing-boot9strap-(browser)) or [Installing boot9strap (MSET)](installing-boot9strap-(mset))!
