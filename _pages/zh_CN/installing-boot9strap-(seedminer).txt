{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading



To install boot9strap on your 11.8.0 device, we exploit an oversight in the security restrictions applied to "DSiWare" applications.

To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the DSiWare encryption key (`movable.sed`) for your device. 

We then use this DSiWare encryption key to decrypt a compatible DSiWare application and inject an exploit into it to run our own code.

If this key were completely random, the encryption key would be impossible to break on current computing hardware. Fortunately, the first half of the key (`movable_part1.sed`) is actually mathematically related to your device's Friend Code, allowing us to break the encryption. For information on how Seedminer works, please see [this presentation](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34⅕c3).

Note that this tool requires a PC with a powerful graphics card to break your device's DSiWare encryption. If you do not have access to one of these, there exists several online helper services where a volunteer running automated software will do this for you.

To use the [magnet](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download).

To extract the `.7z` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

This process will overwrite your DSiWare game's save file!

  + Copy `squirrelboot.3dsx` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Navigate to the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card
1. Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see
  + If you see multiple folders like this, perform the following:
  + Rename the `Nintendo 3DS` folder to `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS`
  + Reinsert your SD card into your device and power on your device
  + Wait for the device to generate the SD card data
  + Power off your device and reinsert your SD card into your computer
  + Navigate to the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card
  + Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see
  + Delete the `Nintendo 3DS` folder
  + Rename the `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS` folder to `Nintendo 3DS`
1. Paste your 32 character long folder name into a document you can reference later
  + This folder name is also known as your "ID0"
1. Navigate to `<ID0>` -> `<32-character-id>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
1. Copy `<8-character-id>.bin` to a folder on your computer
  + The 8 Character ID will be the one from the [Installing boot9strap (DSiWare Game Injection List)](installing-boot9strap-(dsiware-game-injection-list)) page

1. Power on your device
1. Go to your Friend List (the [orange Face Icon]({{ "/images/friend-list-icon.png" | absolute_url }}) in the top row of your Home Menu)
  + If you receive an error and are kicked out of the menu, you either must create a new Mii or your console cannot connect to Nintendo's servers (due to a ban or connection issues)
1. Find your Mii profile, then find the "Friend Code" field on the top screen

#### Section II - Seedminer

JPN ほぼ日の健康手帳™ users should follow [these instructions](http://steelminer.jisagi.net/) instead of this section. Once those instructions have been completed, resume this guide at "Section III - DSiWare Injection".
{: .notice--info}

1. Open [Bruteforce Movable](https://bruteforcemovable.com/) on your computer
  + This site can automate the retrieval of `movable_part1.sed` (using a bot 3DS console) and the breaking of your device's DSiWare encryption (using a volunteer's computer to run Seedminer)
  + If you already have access to a 3DS capable of launching the Homebrew Launcher, you can manually retrieve your `movable_part1.sed` using that device by following [these](https://jisagi.github.io/SeedminerGuide/seedminerSelf/#section1) instructions
  + If you already have access to a PC with a powerful graphics card, you can manually calculate your `movable.sed` using it by following [these](https://jisagi.github.io/SeedminerGuide/seedminerSelf/#section2) instructions
  + If the automated service is nonfunctional and you cannot do one or both of those manually, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you 
1. Enter your device's Friend Code (with no spaces or dashes) into the "Your friend code" field
1. Paste your device's 32 character long folder name into the "Your ID0" field
1. Complete the "I'm not a robot" captcha
1. Select "Go"
1. When prompted, use the "Register Friend" button on your device to add the friend code of the bot 3DS console
1. Wait for the site to update
  + If it does not, refresh the page
1. Select "Continue"
1. Wait for the process to complete
  + This can take a while (up to an hour in some cases)
  + If you are still waiting after an hour, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you 
1. When the process has completed, download your `movable.sed` file from the site

#### Section III - DSiWare Injection

1. Open [TADpole Online](https://jisagi.github.io/TADpole-Online/) on your computer
  + If this site is nonfunctional, try [Project DSIHaxInjector](https://jenkins.nelthorya.net/job/DSIHaxInjector/build)
1. Extract the contents of the DSiWare exploit injection `.zip` to a folder on your computer
1. Select your `<8-character-id>.bin` for the "DSiWare.bin" field
1. Select your `movable.sed` file for the "movable.sed" field
1. Select the downloaded `ctcert.bin` file for the "ctcert.bin" field
1. Select the extracted `game_<your-region>.app` file for the "game_XXX.app" field
  + JPN ほぼ日の健康手帳™ users should be using the files from `USA.zip` instead of `JPN.zip`
1. Select the extracted `public_<your-region>.sav` file for the "public_XXX.sav" field
1. Select "Start!"
1. Wait for the process to complete
1. Rename the created `<8-character-id>.bin.patched` file to `<8-character-id>.bin`
  + Do not confuse this file with the `<8-character-id>.bin` file from earlier
1. 给设备关机
1. 将你的 SD 卡插入到您的计算机
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<32-character-id>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
1. Copy the new `<8-character-id>.bin` file to the `Nintendo DSiWare` folder on your SD card
  + Overwrite the old `<8-character-id>.bin` file when prompted
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device
1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`
1. Under the "SD Card" (or "microSD Card") section, select your compatible DSiWare game
1. Select "Copy", then select "OK"
  + This may have caused your game to appear as "Sudoku" or "4Swords" depending on region; this is normal
  + JPN ほぼ日の健康手帳™ users will be missing ほぼ日の健康手帳™ on the home menu; this is normal
1. Exit System Settings

#### Section IV - Flashing FIRM

1. Launch b9sTool by starting your DSiWare game on your device
  + If prompted, you may have to tap the screen to trigger the exploit
  + JPN ほぼ日の健康手帳™ users should instead run Steeldiver to launch the Homebrew Launcher, then run squirrelboot to launch the patched version of ほぼ日の健康手帳™
1. Select "Install boot9strap" and confirm
1. Exit b9sTool, then power off your device
  + You may have to force power off by holding the power button

#### Section V - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Boot your device while holding (Select) to launch the Luma configuration menu
  + If you encounter issues launching the Luma configuration menu, [follow this troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:    
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#black-screen-on-sysnand-boot-after-installing-boot9strap)
