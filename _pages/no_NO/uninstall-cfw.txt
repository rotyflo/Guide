### Required Reading

This will completely remove CFW from your device, including Boot9Strap and Luma3DS, for the purpose of restoring the device to stock.

This is almost never the solution to fix any issues you encounter with your CFW installation. A better idea would be to read the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting) page or ask (in English) for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).
{: .notice--danger}

Any unsigned (illegitimate) games will be rendered unusable and can be manually removed using the Data Management section of the System Settings. Use a [save manager](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases/latest) to backup any saves for these unsigned (illegitimate) games you care about.

This will not affect your NNID, any legitimately purchased games, or any saves for those legitimately purchased games.

If you have modified critical system software (such as editing the home menu, unbanning your console, etc), uninstalling CFW may BRICK your device!
